\section{Installation Problems}

During the course of installation, you may run into unrecoverable issues.  The pbdR team does not support MPI libraries or R core, so if you have problems during that portion of the installation phase, we probably can not directly help you.  However, there are still many great resources at your disposal, maintained by those individual projects.

\subsection{R and MPI}

If you have problems installing or customizing R, see the \emph{R Installation and Administration Manual} at \url{http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html} for help.

If you are having trouble installing an MPI library, you should see that library's official documentation.  For OpenMPI, see \url{http://www.open-mpi.org/community/help/} and for MPICH, see \url{http://www.mpich.org/documentation/guides/} .

For the remainder, we will be addressing installation issues with pbdR packages.
