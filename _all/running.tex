\section{Running pbdR Scripts}
This information is covered in \emph{much} more detail in the pbdDEMO vignette, and should not be considered a substitute.  However, 

\begin{itemize}
  \item pbdR codes are written in Single Program/Multiple Data style
  \item pbdR codes are executed in batch
\end{itemize}



\begin{lstlisting}[language=rr]
library(pbdMPI, quiet = TRUE)
init()

x <- comm.rank()

comm.print(x, all.rank = TRUE)

finalize()
\end{lstlisting}


\ifnum\value{mac_or_lin}=1
On \maclin, you should execute the command:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
mpirun -np 2 Rscript my_script.r
\end{lstlisting}
\fi

\ifnum\value{include_windows}=1
On Windows, you should execute the command:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
mpiexec.exe -np 2 Rscript my_script.r
\end{lstlisting}
\fi
