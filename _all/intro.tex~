\section{Introduction}

In this guide, we will detail the necessary steps for how to install an MPI library and the pbdR packages.  In decreasing order of difficulty, this involves
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Installing R (and Rtools for Windows) \label{enum:r}
  \item Installing an MPI library\label{enum:mpi}
  \item Installing pbdR
\end{enumerate}

Items \ref{enum:mpi} and \label{enum:r} are interchangeable, and so if you already have R (and Rtools if on Windows) and/or an MPI library installed, then merely skip this step(s); there is no need to reinstall either.
