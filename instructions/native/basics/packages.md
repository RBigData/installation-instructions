# Useful Packages

The lab will use both in instruction and in exercises several package extensions.  To install a package named `pkg` (including automatically handling dependency resolution), start up an R session and enter 
```r
install.packages("pkg")
```

Two packages which we will highlight during the lab which you are strongly recommended to install are:

* rbenchmark
* microbenchmark

If you wish to experiment with (mostly) shared-memory parallelism in R, you might want to install:

* foreach
* doParallel
