# Installation Instructions

This document gives detailed installation instructions for installing a pbdR environment.  This includes the installation of MPI, R, and pbdR packages.

There are two sets of instructions:  one for those who wish to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), and one for those who do not.  Under most circumstances, using the Docker builds is much easier.  This is a good fit for anyone wishing to use pbdR:

* On a desktop/laptop (caveat: OS version has to be reasonably new)
* In the cloud.
* On a cluster running [Singularity](http://singularity.lbl.gov/).

For all other cases, installing the "native" versions will be necessary.
